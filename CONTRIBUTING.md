Contributing
We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

Fork, then clone the repo:

git clone git@github.com:your-username/cards-of-lunacy.git

Work in a virtual environment! Trust me, installing packages to your system python installation is a no no.

Make your changes on a feature branch and submit a pull request.
Wait for me to get around to your pull request. I might suggest some changes, improvements, or alternative approaches. Don't be offended if I might appear to be rude over the internet. I do not have that intent at all, and since I ultimately will be maintaining the projects I'd like to have some say as to what gets in and what stays out.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

Follow PEP-8 please!
Write good commit messages.
Have fairly atomic commits. (no excess clutter, I will ask that you rebase if there is a lot of clutter)
Tests are good!
